# Movie Industry Network Analysis

This project explores the structure and thematic space of the modern film industry using data from IMDb, TMDB, and thousands of screenplays. It supports three poster presentations:

- **Poster 1 (Topic Modeling):** Uses BERTopic to extract themes from screenplays and classify subgenres.
- **Poster 2 (Graph Theory):** Builds and analyzes a Neo4j movie industry graph from cast, crew, and production data.
- **Poster 3 (Data Mining):** Applies clustering and statistical modeling to predict performance and behavior of movies based on graph features.

## Folder Structure

- [`src/`](src): Jupyter notebooks and scripts that power the analysis.
- [`docs/`](docs): Presentation materials and a GitHub Pages dashboard (in progress).
- [`data/`](data): All raw and processed datasets (ignored by `.gitignore`).
- [`docs/plots/`](docs/plots): Visualization assets grouped by method or poster.

## How to Run (WIP)

This project is still being structured for public use. Setup instructions and data access will be added after the posters are finalized.
